# 3ds-randomtitlepicker
3DS homebrew that picks a random title to launch from your SD card


This is a homebrew application for your 3DS, that will pick a random title that is installed on your SD card and launch it.
Handy for those times where you just can't decide on what to play.

HEAVILY based on this 3ds example from DevKitPro: https://github.com/devkitPro/3ds-examples/tree/master/app_launch

Massive thanks to @suchmememanyskill, @bleck9999 and @dorkeline for essentially puppeteering me while making this.
